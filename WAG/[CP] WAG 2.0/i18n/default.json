"AtelierGoods_Jas_Gift.name":"Flowers for the Farmer",

Each edition is jam-packed with helpful hints and tips for honing your foraging skills, so be sure to keep an eye on your mail for more to come!",

"AtelierGoods_SB_Mushroom_Preserve_Mail.name":"Mushrooms and Your Kitchen Mortar",
"AtelierGoods_SB_Mushroom_Preserve_Mail.text":"^^ In today's issue of Shrooms and Blooms, we discuss a variety of edible mushrooms and their uses. Meringue, Wheatberry, Honey Fungus, Chicken of the Woods and Milky White Mushrooms all share a particular naming convention that led us to a great discovery: putting any of these into your Kitchen Mortar will yield common baking ingredients! This may seem hard to believe, but the next time you stumble upon one of these mushrooms, try it. You'll be amazed at what comes out!",

"AtelierGoods_SB_Fruit_Sapling_Mail.name":"Starting Your Fruit Orchard on a Budget.",
"AtelierGoods_SB_Fruit_Sapling_Mail.text":"^^ In today's issue of Shrooms and Blooms, we focus on how foraged fruits can help you start your very own orchard! If the experienced forager stumbles upon 3 of the same fruit while foraging, they can try putting the fruits into their seed maker! Our experts have tested this with a myriad of tree fruits, even tree nuts, and all yield the same glorious results; three of the same fruit transform into a sapling!",

"AtelierGoods_SB_MushLog_Mail.name":"Mushroom Logs for the Avid Mushroom Hunter.",
"AtelierGoods_SB_MushLog_Mail.text":"^^ Today's topic: Mushroom Logs! Mushroom logs are indeed a fantastic way to bring the forage straight to the farm, but did you know you can affect what mushrooms you receive depending on where you place your logs? There are far too many combinations to list, but we here at S&B are fans of placing our mush logs near Wild Food varieties of pistachio, almond, anise, cacao or walnut trees.",

"AtelierGoods_SB_Giant_Crop_Mail.name":"Tips for Growing Giant Crops.",
"AtelierGoods_SB_Giant_Crop_Mail.text":"^^ Dreaming of giant crops? Better get busy turning that forage into seeds - because several forage varieties can become giant if planted on your farm. Shrooms and Blooms has the scoop on some rare giant crops you may be interested in growing. We've heard, from a reliable source in Sunberry Village, that it is possible to grow giant versions of wild strawberries, wild raspberries, Forest Lavender, Pelican Mint and even our favorite mushrooms!",

"AtelierGoods_SB_Spring_Forage_Mail.name":"Forage to Put a Little 'Spring' in Your Step.",
"AtelierGoods_SB_Spring_Forage_Mail.text":"^^ It's finally springtime, S&B fans! This season you'll find Forest Lavender in yep, you guessed it, Cindersap Forest, but stay on the lookout for St. Cannoli Almonds, Petite Lemons, Limes and more across the valley! Pelican mint, like all mints, runs rampant and can often be found by the bus stop, the railroad, or even in town. And for our beachcombers, keep an eye out for the elusive Fern Isle Olive or Cindersap Cilantro!",

"AtelierGoods_SB_Summer_Forage_Mail.name":"Summertime and the Forage is Freeeee.",
"AtelierGoods_SB_Summer_Forage_Mail.text":"^^ Things are heating up as summer arrives in the valley; chamomile and elderberries are popping up over the forest and herbs like sweet basil and lemon thyme can be foraged near the bus stop and railroad. If you're lucky, you may even find a meringue mushroom or chicken of the woods while you're out there as well!",

"AtelierGoods_SB_Fall_Forage_Mail.name":"Don't 'Fall' Behind on Foraging These Important Edibles.",
"AtelierGoods_SB_Fall_Forage_Mail.text":"^^ Though the bounty of summer is over, autumn brings its own unique forage to the valley. Mushroom lovers can find milky white and wheatberry mushrooms in the forest this time of year, and our favorite fall herbs like rosemary and sage can be found along the backwoods, mountain and bus stop. A rare find indeed, but make a visit to the beach every now and then to see if you can spot a Gem Sea Cashew or Gem Isle Jasmine!",

"AtelierGoods_SB_Winter_Forage_Mail.name":"Winter: No Farming Means More Time for Foraging!",
"AtelierGoods_SB_Winter_Forage_Mail.text":"^^ Don't let the colder temps keep you inside all season; there are rich rewards for the courageous forager who ventures out in winter. Hardy rosemary has stuck aorund from fall, but did you know you can find cindersap cinnamon this time of year? It may be on the ground, but try shaking a few mahogany trees, you might get lucky and shake some bark free!",

"AtelierGoods_SB_BushBloom_Mail.name":"Blooming Bushes!",
"AtelierGoods_SB_BushBloom_Mail.text":"^^ Foragers, take note! The bounty of the valley isn't restricted to forage on the forest floor; the bushes across Pelican Town and nearby areas are absolutely brimming with fresh berries! In the beginning of spring, stock up on wild strawberries before they disappear, then do the same for wild raspberries in summer. There's nothing quite like a freshly-picked berry!",

"guidebook.Cauldron.Note":"NOTE: Whenever you update Cauldron, the config will reset to default. ALWAYS check your configs after an update and ensure they are how you want them before loading into the game to prevent accidental error items.",
"guidebook.Cauldron.Global.Title":"1. Global Configs",
"guidebook.Cauldron.Global.Description":"These are important configuration options that affect the mod's functionality.",
"guidebook.Cauldron.WildFood.Title":"Enable Wild Food",
"guidebook.Cauldron.WildFood.Description":"This adds new forage and crops. It is required if you wish to use the 'Advanced' version of the mod, since you need access to new crops like lemons, cacao, marsh mallows etc. If you don't want new crops or forage, simply uncheck this and set the Difficulty Toggle to 'Simple'.",
"guidebook.Cauldron.SpaceCore.Title":"SpaceCore Add On",
"guidebook.Cauldron.SpaceCore.Description":"SpaceCore provides additional functionality to the mod that isn't required, but without it you wouldn't be able to use this guidebook. It also allows for cooking recipes to accept 'any' crop that shares the same context tag instead of a specific item.",

"guidebook.Cauldron.Orders.Title":"Enable Special Orders",
"guidebook.Cauldron.Orders.Description":"This adds special orders related to whichever categories you've enabled in this mod. If you don't want them, simply uncheck this box.",

"guidebook.Cauldron.OrderPriority.Title":"Special Order Priority",
"guidebook.Cauldron.OrderPriority.Description":"If you want to make sure you aren't missing any of the base game special orders, like the ones that unlock the Bone Mill and other craftables, set this to 'Later'. If you want them immediately, then choose 'Immediate'. If you want to ensure you don't miss the Ginger Island ones, pick 'Post-GI'.",

"guidebook.Cauldron.MixedSeeds.Title":"Enable Mixed Seeds",

"guidebook.Cauldron.Difficulty.Description":"This affects what kind of items you can craft with the new machines. ",

"guidebook.Cauldron.Advanced.Description":"'Advanced' mode means there are specific fruits that are used in combination to make specific ales and they have their own unique sprites. Advanced requires Wild Food because you need additional crops to make these items.",

"guidebook.Cauldron.Swapping.Description":"NOTE: Swapping this config does not break your game; you will most likely have 'Error Items' with little red error symbols, but you simply trash those items. However, swapping between these difficulties can cause errors with the custom bundles. Please see the bundles chapter for tips on how to avoid this.",

"guidebook.Cauldron.SimpleAddOn.Title":"Simple Add On",
"guidebook.Cauldron.SimpleAddOn.Description":"If you choose 'Advanced' then the generic rules that apply to the 'Simple' mode of this mod will not work unless you check this box.",
